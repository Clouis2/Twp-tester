	<h1>The Theory <br> <em> behind </em> the mess!</h1>
	<p><em>This was the thought process behind it all.</em></p>
			
			<h2>Welcome, curious mind!</h2> <p>Wait, question, did you clean your room yet? Take out the trash? Are you organized? Well, that aside, it's time for it to go. Some things may just look like garbage, but not always trash. You’re probably wondering why all these random things are laid out here. Honestly, I wasn’t particularly keen on categorizing my recurring waste, but then I started thinking about how I contribute to it. And I thought—why not focus on the unique objects instead? You know, those things that aren’t just discarded but carry their own strange stories.</p>
			
			<p>I remembered the phrase, “One can learn a lot from one’s trash.” It got me wondering: What if the overlooked, the discarded, and the seemingly useless actually had stories to tell? Take, for example, a mangled concert wristband, a crumpled sticky note, or even an old, worn-out car. Each of these carries a glimpse of the past, often frozen in time. These objects, seemingly insignificant to the average person, hold a deep connection to moments long past—moments I may have forgotten or overlooked, but which these objects refuse to let go of.</p>

			<p> The more I thought about it, the more I realized that these bits and pieces aren’t just random fragments; they’re like breadcrumbs leading to stories, memories, and identities. In a way, they can be clues to the person I was and, perhaps, still am. And when I came across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html">Vik Muniz’s</a> article, Reframing Trash into Art (NY Times), it struck me in a profound way. Muniz, in discussing his work with the Gramacho landfill in Brazil, highlighted how even the trash we discard represents parts of our past. He stated that “only fragments of things stubbornly holding on to some residual property or identity remain” (Muniz, 2023), which made me realize something crucial. I’ve been focusing on the “garbage” aspect of these objects, but I should be paying more attention to the identity they carry. These things I throw away may seem useless, but they hold traces of who I am, who I was, and the stories I sometimes forget.</p>
			
			<p>Muniz’s exploration of how human waste, especially from a landfill, can represent fragments of human lives and histories opened my eyes. I started to question what I considered “waste” in my own life. The more I read Muniz’s perspective, the more I understood the layers of meaning behind each discarded item. These aren’t just things I no longer need or want; they are pieces of a narrative that I am sometimes too quick to dismiss. They carry residual energy, identity, and memories that refuse to disappear, despite being forgotten or thrown away. The objects I’ve collected over the course of my “trash of the week” project began to take on new meaning. What once seemed like garbage now appeared to hold value—value not in the material sense, but in its ability to trigger memories and preserve small parts of my life that might otherwise be forgotten.</p>
			
			<p>For instance, I found a worn-out lighter among the items I had discarded. At first glance, it seemed like just another useless object. But as I held it, I remembered the countless times I had used it—especially in moments of celebration, the small successes that defined my younger years. I had even given it a nickname: my lucky lighter. I started to wonder: what does it mean for me to hold on to such an object? Am I holding on to the object, or am I holding on to the feeling it once gave me? The value wasn’t in the lighter itself but in what it represented. That same feeling was echoed in a small toy car I found that once belonged to a child who had an obsession with racing. Who is that child now? Are they still chasing that same passion for speed and adventure? Or has something else replaced it in their life?</p>
			
			<p> Another author who added depth to this conversation is<a href="https://www.annahavron.com/blog/the-souls-of-things-decluttering-and-disposal-as-sacred-acts">Anna Havron</a>, whose exploration of waste as “being alive” made me rethink my approach to collecting discarded objects. Her work showed me how something once deemed worthless could become a vehicle for reflection, admiration, and connection. What if the objects I throw away aren’t just trash, but pieces of a larger story that, once examined, can help me better understand myself? I had previously focused on cataloging waste just because it was easy and mindless, but now, I see that these objects have the power to reveal something deeper—something I may have overlooked in my fast-paced life. As Havron writes, “Your things may be inanimate, but your emotions and memories and associations with those things are very much alive.” This idea reshaped the way I view discarded objects. Rather than seeing them as lifeless remnants of the past, I now recognize that they carry echoes of the experiences, choices, and moments that shaped them—and, in turn, shaped me.</p>
			
			<p> So, I began revising my “trash of the week” project with more intentionality. Instead of merely collecting discarded wrappers and broken items, I started focusing on objects that carried with them more personal significance, even if they were seemingly inconspicuous. As Muniz suggests, “fragments of things” can provide us with insight into our past. And so, I started archiving these objects not just for the sake of recording them, but to reflect on what they might represent about who I am and what I’ve experienced. Whether it was an old ticket stub from a concert or a crumpled receipt, I realized these things were more than just clutter; they were milestones in my journey. They held memories, emotions, and parts of me that would otherwise be forgotten if I didn’t take the time to acknowledge them.</p>
			
			<p> I started to question: What constitutes “true waste”? Is it something that has no use anymore, something that no longer serves a purpose? Or is it something that holds meaning, even if it no longer fits into our current lives? With this new perspective, I began to see my discarded objects not as waste, but as parts of a mosaic of memories that are worth revisiting. Perhaps trash isn’t just trash anymore. It’s a collection of fragments that form a bigger picture of our lives, connecting us to our pasts in ways we often overlook. Each piece tells a story, and by collecting them, I can reflect on those stories, allowing them to speak to me in ways I hadn’t anticipated.</p>
			
			<p> However, I don’t mean for you, the audience, to take all your discarded trash as significant pieces of your life, but to recognize when something is truly worthy of being remembered. I am not saying that I have anything against being a hoarder, nor do I always need to take Muniz’s approach to reframing trash into art, but his perspective has inspired me to rethink the value of discarded objects. It’s not just about the objects themselves; it’s about what they represent—the stories, memories, and identities we leave behind.</p>
			
			<p>As<a href="https://www.upworthy.com/in-world-with-too-much-stuff-we-need-to-reevaluate-our-attachment-to-sentimental-value">Annie Reneau</a> puts it, “The more our lives become saturated with ‘stuff,’ the more we are in danger of holding onto too many things because of the memories or meaning we attach to them.” This idea forces me to question whether I am truly cherishing something or simply holding onto clutter out of habit.</p>
			
			<p>By viewing trash through this lens, I’ve learned to appreciate the meaning embedded in the objects we cast aside, and in doing so, I’ve discovered new ways of understanding my own life and experiences. Perhaps what we discard says as much about us as what we keep. In the end, is it the object that holds meaning, or is it the story we choose to remember? So, how do we decide what is worth keeping and what is simply weighing us down?</p>
