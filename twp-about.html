			<p>Hi, my name is Cory Louis Jean and I am currently a senior at Rutgers University majoring in IT with a minor in business and technical writing. I enjoy playing video games, painting, listening to music, participating in a variety of recreational activities like snowboarding, running, etc and I like to traveling every so often. I recently obtained my Associate's degree in Computer Science. I am currently pursuing a user interface and design certification from Google to strengthen my knowledge in that area. My skills, talents, and knowledge are creativity, graphical design, and attention to detail, and  I am proficient in coding and programming.</p> 
			<p>I love learning about new approaches to tech and contemporary innovation as well as finding unique ways to problem solve.When I am not on some grand adventure or avoiding reality, You can find me shoulders deep into sci-fi lore of some kind or binge watching an entire series, either anime or tv show.</p>
